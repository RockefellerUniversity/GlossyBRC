"PBC_1","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51","The PCRbottleneckCoefficient_1 is calculated as the number of positions in genome with exactly 1 read mapped uniquely compared to the number of positions with at least 1 read."

It is calculated as the number of positions in genome with exactly 1 read mapped uniquely compared to the number of positions with exactly 2 reads mapping uniquely."
"Proper_Pair_Rate","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51","The proportion of paired reads that are aligned in opposite directions and within a reasonable distance of each other on the same reference sequence/chromosome."
"TSSE","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51","The TSS enrichment calculation is a signal to noise calculation. The reads around a reference set of TSSs are collected to form an aggregate distribution of reads centered on the TSSs and extending to 1000 bp in either direction (for a total of 2000bp). This distribution is then normalized by taking the average read depth in the 100 bps at each of the end flanks of the distribution (for a total of 200bp of averaged data) and calculating a fold change at each position over that average read depth."
"blacklist","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#25","ChIPseq will often show the presence of common artifacts, such as ultra-high signal regions. Such regions can confound peak calling, fragment length estimation and QC metrics. ENCODE Data Analysis Center (DAC) blacklisted regions were created as a reference to help deal with these regions."
"peak_calling","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#36","Peak caling is the process of scanning the genome to identify regions with enriched read signal (ideally compared to a control sample) using a count based statistic."
"Percent_Duplicated","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#31","Duplicates reflect reads mapping to exact shared location on the genome. High duplication rates in ChIP-seq are often associated with low complexity libraries but should be assessed in context of total read numbers and antibody efficiency/specificity."
"Percent_Multimapping","NA","Multimapping reads are reads who can be assigned to more than one location with equal certainty. These reads are often associated with repeat regions of genome and high multimapping rates may reflect lower signal to noise for ChIP and higher backgrounds. It should be noted that some ChIPs are for factors or epigenetic marks associated to repeat DNA and so there high multimapping rates should be expected"

Fragment length is determined by systematically shifting the reads on each strand towards each other until the minimum genome coverage is achieved."
"Relative_Cross_Coverage","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#19","The relative cross coverage metric is calculated by comparing the maximum cross coverage peak (at the shift size corresponding to the fragment length) to the cross coverage at a shift size corresponding to the read length, with higher scores (generally 1 or greater) indicating good enrichment."
"Standardized_Standard_Deviation_noBlacklist","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#27","The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score with the blacklist regions removed. SSD scores are dependent on the degree of total genome wide signal pile-up and so are sensitive to regions of high signal found with Blacklisted regions as well as genuine ChIP enrichment."
"Standardized_Standard_Deviation","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#27","The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score is an indication of evidence of enrichment. It is computed by looking at the standard deviation of signal pile-up along the genome normalised to the total number of reads."
"phred_fastq_quality_score","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Genomic_Data//presentations/slides/GenomicsData.html#14","The quality scores (i.e. phred score) for each base (e.g. q20 and q30) reflect the likelihood that the assignment of that base is incorrect. Q = -10*log10(P), with P being the probability, so q30 means there is a probability of 0.001 (0.1%) that the base is incorrect."
