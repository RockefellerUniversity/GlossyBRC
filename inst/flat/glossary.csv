"Mapped_To_Mitochondria_Rate","The proportion of reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51"
"Non_Redundant_Fraction","Number of distinct uniquely mapping reads (i.e. after removing duplicates) / Total number of reads.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51"
"PBC_1","The PCRbottleneckCoefficient_1 is calculated as the number of positions in genome with exactly 1 read mapped uniquely compared to the number of positions with at least 1 read.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51"
"PBC_2","The PCRbottleneckCoefficient_2 is a secondary measure of bottlenecking.

"TSSE","The TSS enrichment calculation is a signal to noise calculation. The reads around a reference set of TSSs are collected to form an aggregate distribution of reads centered on the TSSs and extending to 1000 bp in either direction (for a total of 2000bp). This distribution is then normalized by taking the average read depth in the 100 bps at each of the end flanks of the distribution (for a total of 200bp of averaged data) and calculating a fold change at each position over that average read depth.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATACseq/presentations/slides/RU_ATAC.html#51"

"peak_calling","Peak caling is the process of scanning the genome to identify regions with enriched read signal (ideally compared to a control sample) using a count based statistic.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#36"

"Percent_Multimapping","Multimapping reads are reads who can be assigned to more than one location with equal certainty.

"Relative_Cross_Coverage","The relative cross coverage metric is calculated by comparing the maximum cross coverage peak (at the shift size corresponding to the fragment length) to the cross coverage at a shift size corresponding to the read length, with higher scores (generally 1 or greater) indicating good enrichment.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ChIPseq/presentations/slides/ChIPseq_In_Bioconductor2.html#19"
"Standardized_Standard_Deviation_noBlacklist","The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score with the blacklist regions removed.

"Standardized_Standard_Deviation","The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score is an indication of evidence of enrichment.

"phred_fastq_quality_score","The quality scores (i.e. phred score) for each base (e.g. q20 and q30) reflect the likelihood that the assignment of that base is incorrect. Q = -10*log10(P), with P being the probability, so q30 means there is a probability of 0.001 (0.1%) that the base is incorrect.","https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Genomic_Data//presentations/slides/GenomicsData.html#14"
