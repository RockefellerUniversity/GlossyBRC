It is calculated as the number of positions in genome with exactly 1 read mapped uniquely compared to the number of positions with exactly 2 reads mapping uniquely.","The proportion of paired reads that are aligned in opposite directions and within a reasonable distance of each other on the same reference sequence/chromosome.","The TSS enrichment calculation is a signal to noise calculation. The reads around a reference set of TSSs are collected to form an aggregate distribution of reads centered on the TSSs and extending to 1000 bp in either direction (for a total of 2000bp). This distribution is then normalized by taking the average read depth in the 100 bps at each of the end flanks of the distribution (for a total of 200bp of averaged data) and calculating a fold change at each position over that average read depth.","ChIPseq will often show the presence of common artifacts, such as ultra-high signal regions. Such regions can confound peak calling, fragment length estimation and QC metrics. ENCODE Data Analysis Center (DAC) blacklisted regions were created as a reference to help deal with these regions.","Peak caling is the process of scanning the genome to identify regions with enriched read signal (ideally compared to a control sample) using a count based statistic.","Duplicates reflect reads mapping to exact shared location on the genome. High duplication rates in ChIP-seq are often associated with low complexity libraries but should be assessed in context of total read numbers and antibody efficiency/specificity.","Multimapping reads are reads who can be assigned to more than one location with equal certainty. These reads are often associated with repeat regions of genome and high multimapping rates may reflect lower signal to noise for ChIP and higher backgrounds. It should be noted that some ChIPs are for factors or epigenetic marks associated to repeat DNA and so there high multimapping rates should be expected","The percentage of reads that overlap with called blacklisted regions (see 'blacklist' in glossary below for information on peak calling).","The percentage of reads that overlap with called peak regions (see 'peak_calling' in glossary below for information on peak calling).","In single-end sequencing typically a short strech of the actual dsDNA fragment is sequenced. Fragment length is determined by systematically shifting the reads on each strand towards each other until the minimum genome coverage is achieved.","The relative cross coverage metric is calculated by comparing the maximum cross coverage peak (at the shift size corresponding to the fragment length) to the cross coverage at a shift size corresponding to the read length, with higher scores (generally 1 or greater) indicating good enrichment.","The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score with the blacklist regions removed. SSD scores are dependent on the degree of total genome wide signal pile-up and so are sensitive to regions of high signal found with Blacklisted regions as well as genuine ChIP enrichment.","The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score is an indication of evidence of enrichment. It is computed by looking at the standard deviation of signal pile-up along the genome normalised to the total number of reads.","The quality scores (i.e. phred score) for each base (e.g. q20 and q30) reflect the likelihood that the assignment of that base is incorrect. Q = -10*log10(P), with P being the probability, so q30 means there is a probability of 0.001 (0.1%) that the base is incorrect.","mapped reads that  can be assigned.","alignments that overlap two or more features (feature-level summarization) or meta-features (meta-feature-level summarization).","two ends in a paired end alignment are located on different chromosomes or have unexpected orientation.","alignments marked as duplicate (indicated in the FLAG field).","fragment length inferred from paired end alignment does not meet the length criteria.","alignments that contain junctions.","alignments with a mapping quality score lower than the threshold.","alignments reported for multi-mapping reads (indicated by \u2018NH\u2019 tag).","alignments that do not overlap any feature.","alignments that do not contain junctions.","alignments that do not overlap any feature (or metafeature) with the minimum required overlap length.","Reads that have an unexpected read type (eg. being a single end read included in a paired end dataset) and also cannot be counted with confidence (eg. due to stranded counting). Such reads are typically generated from a read trimming program.","alignments reported as secondary alignments (indicated in the] FLAG field).","read pairs that have only one end mapped.","unmapped reads that cannot be assigned.","BAM is the compressed binary version of the Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format, a compact and index-able representation of nucleotide sequence alignments.","The bigWig format is for display of dense, continuous data that will be displayed in a genome browser (e.g. IGV or UCSC) as a graph. Examples of this type of data include ChIP-seq and RNA-seq read signal.","A text-based file containing both a sequence (e.g. nucleotide sequence) and the quality scores for that particular sequence encoded by an ASCII character.","GTF (Gene Transfer Format) is an extension of GFF (General Feature Format) that is comprised of 9 tab separated columns, and links features (e.g. exons) to genomic locations. GTF extends GFF by adding a column with meta-feature information (e.g. gene/transcript identifiers).","A reference fasta is a collection of contigs that serves as a pre-built map of a particular oprganisms genome and allows for genomic features to be evaluated in their linear genomic context. Contigs are stretches of DNA sequence encoded as A,G,C,T,N and in this case are represented in a fasta file format containing information about that contig.","The mapping of a gene to alternative IDs, symbols, and functional annoation is contained in the Bioconductor OrgDb packages.","The number of instrument cycles in which 80% or more of base calls were no-calls.","One of either UNPAIRED (for a fragment run), FIRST_OF_PAIR when metrics are for only the first read in a paired run, SECOND_OF_PAIR when the metrics are for only the second read in a paired run or PAIR when the metrics are aggregated for both first and second reads in a pair.","The mean read length of the set of reads examined. When looking at the data for a single lane with equal length reads this number is just the read length.
