Relative_Cross_Coverage: 
 definition: The relative cross coverage metric is calculated by comparing the maximum cross coverage peak (at the shift size corresponding to the fragment length) to the cross coverage at a shift size corresponding to the read length, with higher scores (generally 1 or greater) indicating good enrichment.
