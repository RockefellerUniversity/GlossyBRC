Standardized_Standard_Deviation_noBlacklist: 
 definition: The standardized standard deviation (SSD) score with the blacklist regions removed. SSD scores are dependent on the degree of total genome wide signal pile-up and so are sensitive to regions of high signal found with Blacklisted regions as well as genuine ChIP enrichment.
