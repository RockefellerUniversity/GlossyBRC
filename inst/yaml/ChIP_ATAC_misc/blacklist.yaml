blacklist: 
 definition: ChIPseq will often show the presence of common artifacts, such as ultra-high signal regions. Such regions can confound peak calling, fragment length estimation and QC metrics. ENCODE Data Analysis Center (DAC) blacklisted regions were created as a reference to help deal with these regions.
