phred_fastq_quality_score: 
 definition:The quality scores (i.e. phred score) for each base (e.g. q20 and q30) reflect the likelihood that the assignment of that base is incorrect. Q = -10*log10(P), with P being the probability, so q30 means there is a probability of 0.001 (0.1%) that the base is incorrect.
